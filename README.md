Just another Repository
Hi! I'm Victoria
I'm new in GitHub and I'm starting to learn how it works. Any help that I can receive will be highly appreciated.
I'll be telling you a bit more about me so you can know who I am. I'm from Belize, my hobbies are to play sports, watching tv programs, learning and discovering new things/skills and listeing to music.
